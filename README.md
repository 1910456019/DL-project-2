# Project: Deep-Learning-P2

Note the code for this porgam is runing through google colab. if you want to run the code. please mount with you personal google drive at "connect google drive" cell. Also, modify your own saving path for output_dir at Run Inference on unlabelled dataset section. 

The below text are the title for the code. if you want to find any part of code in notebook. you can copy the title and use control F to find the code cell in notebook.


### Starter Notebook
- Install and import required libraries
- Load Tokenizer and Preprocess Data
- Load Pre-trained Model


### Anything from here on can be modified(Tuning)
- Setup LoRA Config
- Training Setup
- Evaluate Finetuned Model
- Run Inference on eval_dataset
- Run Inference on unlabelled dataset
